# breadboard_blink_LED
In this repository there is file for the circuit diagram and the particle project to blink the LED.

// Instructions to build the circuit:
//
// 1. Connect particle argon to breadboard.
// 1.5. Ground pin of particle argon to ground rail. 
// 2. Connect jumper wire to desire GPIO pin of particle argon.
// 3. Input other end of jumoper wire into desired row of breadboard.
// 4. Place anode of LED into same row of breadboard. 
// 5. Relay cathode to next row of breadboard. 
// 6. Use resistor to correct row/cathode to ground rail.
