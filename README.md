# breadboard_blink_LED
In this repository there is file for the circuit diagram and the particle project to blink the LED.

Instructions to build the circuit:

1. Connect particle argon to breadboard.
2.  Ground pin of particle argon to ground rail.
3. Connect jumper wire to desire GPIO pin of particle argon.
4. Input other end of jumoper wire into desired row of breadboard.
5. Place anode of LED into same row of breadboard.
6. Relay cathode to next row of breadboard.
7. Use resistor to correct row/cathode to ground rail.
